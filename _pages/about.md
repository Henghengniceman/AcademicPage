# <i class="fa fa-cog fa-spin fa-fw"></i> About me #

* I have been a Research Scientist at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/) since Jul. 2019. I worked as an Intelligent Video Analytics Intern at [NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/) from Jun. 2018 to Mar. 2019. My research interests lie in computer vision, machine (deep) learning, and multimedia. 

* I graduated with a Ph.D. degree from the Department of Electrical & Computer Engineering (ECE) at the [University of Washington (UW)](http://www.washington.edu/) in Jun. 2019. My advisor was [Prof. Jenq-Neng Hwang](https://people.ece.uw.edu/hwang/). I received my M.S. degree in Electrical Engineering also from UW in Mar. 2016. And my B.Sc. (Eng.) degree was received from the [Joint Programme](http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/study-abroad/joint-programme-bupt/) between Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT) and Queen Mary, University of London (QMUL) with First Class Honours in Jun. 2014. 

* The team from UW that I led was a two-time winner of the [AI City Challenge](https://www.aicitychallenge.org/) in 2017 and 2018. I am currently a member of the organizing committee of the upcoming 4th AI Challenge Workshop in CVPR 2020.
