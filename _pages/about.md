# <i class="fa fa-cog fa-spin fa-fw"></i> About me #

* I am a Ph.D student in [karlsruhe institute of technology(KIT)](https://www.kit.edu/english/) at [Institute of Meteorology and Climate Research
Atmospheric Aerosol Research (IMK-AAF)](https://www.imk-aaf.kit.edu/index.php) since Oct. 2019. 

* My research interesting is on aerosol and cloud remote sensing.Now I am doing this reserach work with the Financial support of [MOSES project](https://moses-data.gfz-potsdam.de/onestop/#/)  
* I gradated with a Master from [School of aemospheric physics](https://sap.nuist.edu.cn/) at [Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology](https://www.nuist.edu.cn/)
