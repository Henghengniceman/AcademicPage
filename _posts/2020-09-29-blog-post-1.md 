The first project I have worked on at Amazon was launched. [Amazon One](https://one.amazon.com/) is an innovation to make everyday activities effortless.

We developed a non-contact biometric identification system for palm signatures captured using light of varying polarity, which enables a fast, convenient, contactless approach for everyday activities like paying at a store, presenting a loyalty card, entering a location like a stadium, or badging into work. The service is designed to be highly secure and uses custom-built algorithms and hardware to create a person’s unique palm signature.
